# FIDO

FIDO - Dog Library
Hi! I made this thing called FIDO. It's basically a website where you can look at different dog breeds. I was tired of boring dog websites so I made one that's actually fun to use with extra features...

What it does:
Looks good (I think)
Dark mode by default because my eyes hurt

Light mode if you're one of those people

Rainbow mode for when you're feeling wild

The dogs
There's 15 breeds in here. Each one has:

A photo (gotta add better ones later)

Where they're from

How big they are

What they're like

Some info about them

A fun fact because why not

Stuff you can click
Theme button - changes colors

Surprise button - makes everything rainbow

Bark button - makes a barking sound (kinda)

How to move around
Scroll up and down

Click the dots on the side

Click dog pictures to go to next one

Use arrow keys if you're lazy

How to use it
Just open the HTML file. It works in Chrome, Firefox, whatever.

Click things. See what happens. If it breaks, refresh.

Technical stufff: 
It's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No fancy frameworks. I used:

CSS Grid for the layout

Local storage to remember your theme

Some audio stuff for the bark

Images from Unsplash (need to add my own later)

Things I need to fix
Add my own dog pictures  that fit better 

Make the bark sound better

Add more breeds maybe

Fix that weird mobile spacing

Why I made it
I own an australian collie and i wanted to learn more about other dogs!
